# Containers Probes

## Task 1 - Liveness and Readiness probe

Define a liveness and readiness HTTP request that will fail

- [containers-probe.yaml](https://github.com/YeffaDev/learn-kubernetes-brownbag/blob/master/lab/yaml/07/containers-probe.yaml)

```
vi containers-probe.yaml                   # The probes point the the wrong container port
kubectl get events --watch &               # The initialDelaySeconds field tells the kubelet that it should wait 10 seconds before performing the first probe.
clear
kubectl apply -f containers-probe.yaml     # The periodSeconds field specifies that the kubelet should perform a probe every 5 seconds.
fg
CTRL-C
kubectl get pod                            # Restart is increasing, , POD is not ready
kubectl describe pods                      # Events
kubectl delete -f containers-probe.yaml
```

- After 10 sec the POD is restarted by liveness probe
- The POD is "not ready" because of readiness probe

Fix the liveness and readiness probe [UP TO YOU]

## Task 2 - Startup probe

Create our deployment with a faulty startup probe

- [container-probes-startup.yaml](https://github.com/YeffaDev/learn-kubernetes-brownbag/blob/master/lab/yaml/07/container-probes-startup.yaml)

```
vi container-probes-startup.yaml                   # the startup probes point the the wrong container port 8081
kubectl get events --watch &                       # liveness and readiness probe won't be executes
clear
kubectl apply -f container-probes-startup.yaml     # The container will be restarted after 1 failures,default is 3 (according the to restart policy)
fg
CTRL-C
kubectl get pod                            # Restart is increasing, POD is not ready
kubectl describe pods                      # Events repeating
kubectl delete -f container-probes-startup.yaml
```

Fix the startup probe [UP TO YOU]
